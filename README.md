# Custom index of page in php
Customise what is displayed when a user goes to an un-built directory on your website. usually you will see a simple white page with links called "Index of [directory]".. this little php script is simple to use and provides a better feel to your un worked on pages or downloads list.

#### Features
- File / Folder recognition
- Automatic page name
- Filesize of every document computed in a readable format 


## How to use:
Simply edit the `index.php` file changing line 53 to be your Font-Awesome free URL.
```
<script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/YOURCUSTOM.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
                                         ^^^^^^^^^^
```


Now drop the php file into any directory you havent built yet! visit the URL and thats it!
